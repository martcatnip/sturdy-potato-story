<<<<<<< HEAD Every potato has a dream of becoming chips. Sure, why wouldn't they? Although potatoes themselves may be a little rough on the edges, 
chips look so clean and tastes good. However, there is one sturdy potato whose way to becoming potato chips was not simple and smooth as it has broken 
every single cutter it encountered! "How should I become a potato chip", he said. Legend says that there exists an indestructible potato cutter in the 
unknown areas of the world and no one has ever reached it before. So this rough potato went on a mission to the unknown in order to find the 
indestructable cutter. The potato had know idea where to start in getting to the unknown.  Then one day, it had a dream.  A path was shown to get to 
the unknown.  Now, all it had to do was take the path it had envisioned in the dream.

First the potato had to survive the land of mashing, the desolate place where unwanted potatoes were sent to turn into mash potatoes in the fall. And next he
had to cross the Broiling Basins. He made sure not to step in any of the ovens or else he would be turned into a baked potato and mission would fail.
