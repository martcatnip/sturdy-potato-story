Every potato has a dream of becoming chips. Sure, why wouldn't they? Although potatoes themselves may be a little rough on the edges, chips look so clean and tastes good. However, there is one sturdy potato whose way to becoming potato chips was not simple and smooth as it has broken every single cutter it encountered! "How should I become a potato chip", he said. Legend says that there exists an indestructible potato cutter in the unknown areas of the world and no one has ever reached it before.
